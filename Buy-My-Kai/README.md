# Buy My Kai :house:

Buy My Kai is a web app that connects people through the food we grow in our backyard. If you have a green thumb and would like to share your produce with the community you can signup as a Grower and list what produce you would like to sell or trade. If you're a foodie and on the hunt for local and fresh produce you can signup as an Eater and search for Growers in your neighbourhood.

#### Our Mission:

- Increase the quantity of sustainably grown foods

- Provide a platform to make it more accessible to buy, sell and trade produce all year round

- Give passionate Eaters better access to local, home grown food

- Reduce food waste

- Encourage more sustainable living

- Make the world a better place  :seedling:
